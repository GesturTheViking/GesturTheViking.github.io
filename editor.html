          Editor

        <!-- <p>
          For the group game project <i>Toys "R" Sus</i>, I was tasked with creating a level editor tool for the level designers in my group to use. During the group's previous project, <i>Loa of Death</i>, the levels were built in Unity's editor and then exported to our engine using a script. Whilst this approached did work, we felt it was an unergonomic and inconvenient pipeline in the long run. We had also decided that the new project was only going to have one big level, which all three level designers and the artists would work on at the same time, which made creating a new level-creation pipeline especially imperative, since doing this with the previous pipeline would be difficult. This is why we decided to make our own editor, which was to be tailored to the content creators' needs and wants. In addition, a strong emphasis was to be put on collaboration features, such as easily mergeable levels and eventually also multi-user editing support, making it easy for multiple people to collaborate on the same level.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
          When it came down to designing the editor itself and all its features, it was pivotal to facilitate an open dialogue with the level designers. They provided me with a wishlist of features before I started work on the project, which I used as a guide for its principal design. As the editor developed and they started using it to build levels, they continually provided feature requests and feedback on how it could be improved. This made it easy for me to improve the editor with each iteration.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the tools I had made for the previous project was made using <i>Dear ImGui</i>, so it was a natural choice for the GUI of the editor. It allows for building intuitive user interfaces quickly, but its main advantage is that tools written using it can run on the same engine as the game, reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.
          <br><br>
          The architecture of the editor was kept simple, to allow for the other programmers to implement features in the editor with as little friction as possible. At its core, the editor has a window system that is just a list of all the windows in the application. Each entry in the list contains the some meta information about the window, its state as well as a function pointer to update and render that window. The windows are then managed and updated automatically, as well as added to the view menu. This allows for new windows to be integrated with only a few lines of code.
          <br><br>
          Implementing a scene hierarchy window was painless using the enity-component-system implementation I made the previous project, which I discuss in detail in the next article.
